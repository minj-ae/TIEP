# TIEP
Traffic Information Exchange Protocol

TIEP (Traffic Information Exchange Protocol) is an experimental network protocol designed to facilitate the exchange of traffic information between routers. It utilizes eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to efficiently capture and analyze network traffic at the kernel level.

TIEP represents a next-generation networking protocol, poised to revolutionize traffic management and routing decisions. By leveraging the collected traffic data, it opens up possibilities for advanced machine learning applications in network optimization and security.
Operating at Layer 3 of the OSI model, TIEP integrates seamlessly with existing IP-based networks while providing enhanced capabilities for traffic analysis and information exchange.
